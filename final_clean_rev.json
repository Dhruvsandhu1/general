If it\u2019s a vanilla setup with common apps, and users are empowered to do things like add their own printers with AirPrint; InTune is just fine.  You can add extras like XCreds or JAMF Connect to enable IdP login + LAPs and you\u2019re good to go. \n\nIf you need to heavily curate the user experience, that\u2019s where JAMF is worth the money. Zero touch OS upgrades, printer driver install and setup on demand, unique app deployment scenarios; all of that is easier with JAMF. Easier in the end, but it trashes a lot of time dialing it in. \n\nI have a large institution where we manage a fleet of nearly a thousand of Macs & iPads with JAMF. I have a smaller client that\u2019s 50/50 Mac and PC; we do that all within InTune. \n\nIf you\u2019re already an M365 shop, try InTune first IMO. JAMF will always be there to take your money if you want to make the jump. \ud83e\udd2a",

Although it offers automation, we frequently experience issues where updates fail to install as planned. This leads to extra manual work and concerns about keeping our devices secure.\n\nAdditionally, the remote support functionality can be unreliable. Connection drops and lag during sessions make it difficult for our team to assist users effectively. When you rely on tech support, these delays can lead to significant downtime.\n\nLastly, the user interface feels a bit outdated and cluttered. It can be challenging to navigate, even for experienced team members. The documentation could also use a refresh; it often lacks the clarity needed during critical moments.\n\nOverall, while Jamf has promising features, the lack of reliable customer support and some functional shortcomings make it tough for us to fully endorse it.

Advanced Searches with email schedules, Smart Groups (worth every dime) and Extension Attributes allow for workflows and automation, and huge list of API commands.  I would not be able to do my job as efficiently on Kandji.  I am constantly pulled into Security meetings to help identify and remediate vulnerabilities in our computers.  Using Extension Attributues to identify subjects, Smart Groups as the target of custom policies that deliver a remediation script or package, all automated and reported is just not do able in Kandji.

The basic building blocks of extension attributes, smart groups, policies, packages, scripts, and configuration profiles are like another programming language for me. The API is also critical to how I manage my devices/computers.\n\nLooking at Kandji I see a lot of the same functionality, but there's a lot more focus on the additional tools that sit on top of that base layer of building blocks. The built-in App deployments, OS Updates, Reporting, and Compliance Mapping look to be really awesome, with the caveat that if how Kandji does it isn't 100% how you want it done you will have to jump through some serious hoops to get what you want. Kandji is more of a \"it just works\" solution - and I'm well past that. I prefer a \"I can make it work EXACTLY the way I want it to\" solution, and for me, that's Jamf Pro.\n\nI'm not knocking Kandji - it's a GREAT solution, and more affordable than Jamf Pro by far. I was just jumping in here in response to the claim that:\n\n>I did the deployment alone for a 400 user company and I feel that would never happen with Jamf.\n\nDifferent tools for different use cases.

Mac really feels like a side note for them. I will also note that Jamf Pro has some amazing integrations with Intune, so using BOTH platforms is actually the best.\n\niOS devices: InTune is a bit better for iOS. However, one of the major drawbacks is that it takes 8 - 24 HOURS to send any MDM command, where as Jamf Pro (and most other MDMs) will take less than 1 MINUTE.",

Sadly some customers don\u2019t see this the same way. Group creation alone is so much more dynamic with this. Intune\u2018s groups are.. bad in comparison.

        "body": "Thanks for your question. I think Jamf is a solid player in the mobile device management (MDM) and Mac management space. The company has a historic relationship with Apple Field Engineering and is used by Apple internally to manage Apple Retail Store devices. Their support teams have historically been very good, industry leading, but they do have some struggles due to being a bootstrapped company (started in 2002, VC acquisition in 2017, IPO 2020).\n\nIMO there is questionable leadership and they continually access consultants to support their operations, which is common for a large, complex organization. They also struggle with diversity and inclusion, which has become more important in recent years for financial and operational success. The quality of their software and support has slipped over the years due to these recent changes, which enables them to stay current with the market.\n\nWith Fleetsmith being acquired by Apple, versus Jamf, I think the writing is on the wall. Historically companies that are acquired tend to implode, however Jamf went IPO in 2020. It remains a modern tool for Apple device management.",

Mosyle was first to implement an app catalog and admin privilege requests, and their user interface looks a lot more user friendly than Jamf.

But it's well worth the energy once you watch a user un-box a factory Mac and quickly get to a fully configured desktop complete with a user account, mail, apps, documents, and preferences -- all with zero IT touch.Without full directory integration and user account snycronization, we were assigning IT staff to perform user account creation for each end user. While we could push apps and services with Jamf Pro, Jamf Connect added the final step. Now a user simply logs into a properly enrolled company-owned Mac with their email credentials ... and magically a full, local user account is created.

        "body": "We switched from Jamf Cloud with Connect to Kandji two months ago. So far we absolutely love it. To us, Jamf was a toolbox whereas Kandji was ready to use out of the box. We love the layout and readability of the console, even the creature comforts like being able to see details about a blueprint item without having to go to the library whereas Jamf would require you to open another tab to compare two pages. The things visible to the user, such as Passport and the agent, have a much nicer appearance and appear to belong in macOS, unlike Jamf.\n\nWe had our demo environment doing great in one week. Most of our profiles were recreated and configured within a week. We find Passport to be more reliable and user-friendly than Connect. Liftoff has worked perfectly. The user agent does well to inform the user of updates or actions needed.\n\nWe actually migrated at a fast pace. Our Jamf contract was ending two weeks from the day we signed with Kandji, and since they don't let you test the migration tool we risked it.\n\nWe had one major migration hurdle: Jamf was deploying Wi-Fi via a config profile. As soon as Kandji forced Jamf to unenroll a device it would lose the office Wi-Fi connection and the device was stranded because the deletion of the config profile removed the active SSID. To mitigate, we started a temporary Wi-Fi network, pushed it as a script, and then the Kandji migration tool would wait long enough for the device to see the temp network and connect.\n\nWe made it! Before Jamf expired we sent all remaining devices (there weren't many) an MDM unenroll command from Jamf. In Apple Business Manager we pointed all devices to Kandji. Then those devices could do sudo profiles -N to re-enroll based on what Apple Business Manager pointed them to.\n\nKandji's use of rules on blueprint items means we only need a few blueprints. We chose to do one blueprint for production, one for conference room equipment, and one for secured special devices. Other blueprints can be used for testing.\n\nKandji Prism is a new search feature that works well.\n\nIt's nice that Kandji licenses users instead of devices. We can now enroll iPads, iPhones, and Apple TVs along with Macs.\n\nI do have to give Kandji one F grade: You're assigned a migration specialist at the start. This is who provides your custom migration script. In our case the specialist only responded to us about once a day no matter how urgent. They also said more than once that they had added colleagues to our case but we never heard from anyone else. On the flip side, chat support and their documentation has been great.\n\nIf you are looking for something that works well from the start, Kandji is not a bad choice. I'm looking forward to full Platform SSO authentication support next year. (Giving it time in the oven.) Apple is still polishing it and Kandji supports it but we want to let them work any bugs out.",

        "body": "As an IT Manager for a fintech company with 5,000+ employees, we implemented Jamf hoping it would streamline device management, remote support, and patching. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t meet the demands of our environment.\n\nThe remote assistance tools were slow and unreliable, with frequent connection drops during sessions\u2014frustrating for both IT and end-users. Patch management was inconsistent, with some critical updates failing to apply automatically, requiring manual intervention. The inability to schedule patches flexibly across time zones also disrupted our global workforce.\n\nWhile Jamf offers a lot of features, the learning curve was steep. Even my experienced team needed weeks to get comfortable, and documentation wasn\u2019t easy to navigate in urgent situations. Scalability was another issue, as bulk actions failed randomly without clear error messages, slowing down operations. The reporting tools were too basic for the compliance requirements we need in fintech.\n\nJamf may work for smaller companies, but for large, compliance-heavy environments, it didn\u2019t deliver. We\u2019re already exploring alternatives that offer more reliable patching, better remote support, and smoother scaling.",

It also makes deploying apps and polices a breeze. Aside from that, the amount of features available for finely tuning mobile devices is second to none.\n\nOutside of the Jamf Pro itself, our customer success rep Taylor is phenomenal. She is always availble to answer our questions, has a wealth of knowledge when it comes to Jamf, and in the rare occurence where she doesn't have the answer, she will either put us in touch with who does or gets back to us lightning fast!I wish there was the ability to drag and drop your categories to sort them how you like. Removing and adding everything 1 by 1 is tedious.As a remote company, being able to deploy devices with minimum of user interaction for setup is crucial. Our onboarding process has been streamlined with the help of Jamf and allowed the IT team to minimize our weekly footprint within those meetings.\n\nKeeping track of our 1000+ devices and making sure we're staying in our compliances and staying on top of application and OS updates.",

        "body": "We moved from Kandji to Jamf and although Jamf has a bit of a learning curve, it\u2019s worth it. The compliance editor template is a godsend for quickly applying security policies and the patch management is rock solid compared to Kandji. Kandji also offers less flexibility in terms of pricing. You still have to pay for 50 or 100 devices even if you have half of that and you have to get the entire suite (passport was optional before). There was also a nasty bug we encountered where even after we removed the Kandji MDM profile, the passport (IdP SSO) still stuck around and we weren\u2019t able to enroll it to Jamf forcing us to wipe it. Their initial sales rep also gave us a pricing commitment for 3 years but when it came to renewal after one, the account manager was rotated and they jacked up our prices saying \u201cI don\u2019t know that guy but here\u2019s what we charge.\u201d",

        "body": "Currently using Jamf Business and discussions around renewal have begun. I am wondering if it is worth staying on Jamf in 2024 as a Kandji license (w/ liftoff) + a license for a more robust (third-party) EDR than Jamf Protect costs less than a Jamf Business license.\n\nI know Jamf has a more powerful API, but we are a relatively small shop and most Mac administration is currently done via Jamf\u2019s GUI.\n\nAside from that, any pros for Jamf or cons for Kandji, that warrants the difference in price, I should consider before making the change?",

Their auto app patching and user friendly UI (both in the console and on device) is what put it over the top for me.\n\nLiftoff is super nice (we\u2019ve gotten multiple compliments from end users) and we can confidently be zero touch and have a great experience for our employees.\n\nSomething that hasn\u2019t been said but has been my favorite \u201cfeature\u201d of Kandji is their support team. Jamf\u2019s is notoriously bad (they make it up with a great community) but with Kandji, you can open up a live chat in the admin console with an agent and be chatting in < 3min. Any issue, big or small, they are right there to help with.\n\nPlus it\u2019s cheaper lol.\n\nEdit: I also forgot to mention the one thing I miss from Jamf is smart groups.. that is the one thing I really feel like Kandji is lacking. Other than that, they are apples to apples with Kandji taking the slight edge.",

        "body": "We've been on JAMF for about 4 years now and the renewal price prompted management to ask us to look for alternatives. One of the execs had been in contact with Kandji already who had been pitching they were a cheaper option so we reached out and setup a trial. I was very clear the only reason we were considering moving was price.\n\nAlthough I was impressed with Kandji and we were able to replicate about 60% of what we use JAMF for in the first week of trail, they still hadn't given us a quote. They had asked if they could see what we were paying for JAMF before quoting us and that seemed a bit shady. Like a plumbing contractor wanting to see your other bids before quoting a job. We figured they had standard pricing, but depending on the number of clients and perhaps multi year contracts they could give us a lower than standard pricing. Well, this morning they finally gave us our quote after we told them we weren't comfortable showing what we were paying for JAMF first. It was more than we currently pay for JAMF AND that included a 20% discount if we signed up quickly.\n\nI can't think of any other company we deal with that tries to price this way.\n\nThey quoted us mid $30,000s for 400 system and that doesn't include their end point protection.\n\nAnyone out there mind sharing what they currently pay for Kandji and how many seats? The sales rep told me they've seen people paying between $4/seat/month for JAMF up to $14/seat/\n\nJamf pro's standard pricing is $7/seat/month right now for just the MDM, so I'm not sure where he's getting numbers higher than that unless that includes extra Jamf services that we don't have and were never part of our conversation.\n\nComments on here seemed mostly positive and everyone seemed to indicate they were substantially less expensive.",

        "body": "We switched from Jamf Cloud with Connect to Kandji two months ago. So far we absolutely love it. To us, Jamf was a toolbox whereas Kandji was ready to use out of the box. We love the layout and readability of the console, even the creature comforts like being able to see details about a blueprint item without having to go to the library whereas Jamf would require you to open another tab to compare two pages. The things visible to the user, such as Passport and the agent, have a much nicer appearance and appear to belong in macOS, unlike Jamf.\n\nWe had our demo environment doing great in one week. Most of our profiles were recreated and configured within a week. We find Passport to be more reliable and user-friendly than Connect. Liftoff has worked perfectly. The user agent does well to inform the user of updates or actions needed.\n\nWe actually migrated at a fast pace. Our Jamf contract was ending two weeks from the day we signed with Kandji, and since they don't let you test the migration tool we risked it.\n\nWe had one major migration hurdle: Jamf was deploying Wi-Fi via a config profile. As soon as Kandji forced Jamf to unenroll a device it would lose the office Wi-Fi connection and the device was stranded because the deletion of the config profile removed the active SSID. To mitigate, we started a temporary Wi-Fi network, pushed it as a script, and then the Kandji migration tool would wait long enough for the device to see the temp network and connect.\n\nWe made it! Before Jamf expired we sent all remaining devices (there weren't many) an MDM unenroll command from Jamf. In Apple Business Manager we pointed all devices to Kandji. Then those devices could do sudo profiles -N to re-enroll based on what Apple Business Manager pointed them to.\n\nKandji's use of rules on blueprint items means we only need a few blueprints. We chose to do one blueprint for production, one for conference room equipment, and one for secured special devices. Other blueprints can be used for testing.\n\nKandji Prism is a new search feature that works well.\n\nIt's nice that Kandji licenses users instead of devices. We can now enroll iPads, iPhones, and Apple TVs along with Macs.\n\nI do have to give Kandji one F grade: You're assigned a migration specialist at the start. This is who provides your custom migration script. In our case the specialist only responded to us about once a day no matter how urgent. They also said more than once that they had added colleagues to our case but we never heard from anyone else. On the flip side, chat support and their documentation has been great.\n\nIf you are looking for something that works well from the start, Kandji is not a bad choice. I'm looking forward to full Platform SSO authentication support next year. (Giving it time in the oven.) Apple is still polishing it and Kandji supports it but we want to let them work any bugs out.",

With Jamf we would remove the jamf license from a device, but the previous record would remain in the UI so that we could look back on who had the device previously and any repairs it may have had. In order to reclaim a Kandji license, you have to delete the device record from Kandji entirely. Its a cheap way to get you to have to buy more licenses.",

The compliance editor template is a godsend for quickly applying security policies and the patch management is rock solid compared to Kandji. Kandji also offers less flexibility in terms of pricing. You still have to pay for 50 or 100 devices even if you have half of that and you have to get the entire suite (passport was optional before). There was also a nasty bug we encountered where even after we removed the Kandji MDM profile, the passport (IdP SSO) still stuck around and we weren\u2019t able to enroll it to Jamf forcing us to wipe it. Their initial sales rep also gave us a pricing commitment for 3 years but when it came to renewal after one, the account manager was rotated and they jacked up our prices saying \u201cI don\u2019t know that guy but here\u2019s what we charge.\u201d",

The API is also critical to how I manage my devices/computers.\n\nLooking at Kandji I see a lot of the same functionality, but there's a lot more focus on the additional tools that sit on top of that base layer of building blocks. The built-in App deployments, OS Updates, Reporting, and Compliance Mapping look to be really awesome, with the caveat that if how Kandji does it isn't 100% how you want it done you will have to jump through some serious hoops to get what you want.

I prefer a \"I can make it work EXACTLY the way I want it to\" solution, and for me, that's Jamf Pro.\n\nI'm not knocking Kandji - it's a GREAT solution, and more affordable than Jamf Pro by far.

However, one of the major drawbacks is that it takes 8 - 24 HOURS to send any MDM command, where as Jamf Pro (and most other MDMs) will take less than 1 MINUTE.\n\nAs someone who has extensive experience with both JAMF Pro and Intune (my previous job was managing almost 30k iPads and 2k Macs with JAMF Pro; my current job is managing a much smaller fleet with Intune), I would vote that JAMF Pro *far* surpasses Intune for iOS and iPadOS (plus macOS, of course) in terms of usability, flexibility, granularity, and reporting, especially as your fleet size increases.\n\n*HOWEVER*, the idea that Intune takes \"8-24 hours to send any MDM command\" is not accurate in the slightest, at least for Apple devices (Windows devices are a different ballgame). Make the change in Intune, wait maybe 1-2 minutes, sync the device, and it happens fast...just like in JAMF Pro. It's all built on APNS just like all the other Apple MDMs. The difference is in the *reporting speed*. JAMF Pro updates it's reports much, much faster than Intune, which can take a few minutes (example: a script that Intune deploys to a Mac might *run* quickly, but the report showing that it ran might take awhile to show up in Intune).\n\nPart of Intune's issues (for macOS) is lack of good documentation about how it works behind the scenes on the device, and where to go for troubleshooting. I've found a few \"gotchas\" that just aren't documented anywhere I can find, and I only discovered them through trial and error. \n\n* Example 1: the limitation on line length for shell scripts. [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts) shows a 200KB file size limit but doesn't speak of a *line limit* for scripts. There didn't used to be a line limit that I could tell, but one day awhile back a 2,500 line shell script I was running on all my Macs stopped running, and I discovered through some troubleshooting that Microsoft had imposed  a line limit of ~1,200 lines. I can't find that documented *anywhere*. I had to completely rewrite that script and make a second script as a workaround for it due to that limitation (which wasn't communicated to Intune admins, nor was it documented).\n\n* Example 2: Microsoft's documentation doesn't tell you where they store the local logs for Intune on Macs (if you're curious, they're under /Library/Logs/Microsoft/Intune). They don't also tell you that if you try to sync your Mac to Intune too soon after another sync, Company Portal will *say* it successfully synced, but the actual log file says *\"Not enough time has passed since last check-in; adjusting check-in request.\"* and then doesn't really do anything. It's best to wait about 5 minutes between syncing your Mac with Intune so it will do a full sync instead of just gaslighting you into thinking it synced, when it didn't. Lastly, they don't tell you that the only real way to figure out which policies are running on the Mac (when looking at the local Intune log) is to find the policy ID for the script you want to check in the *URL for the script in Intune*, then search for that policy ID in the Intune log locally on the Mac.",

Since then our support has been much better... but could be coincidence. \n\nI've recently opened several tickets with them and gotten decent responses. Honestly my biggest frustration is how long it takes them to implement features or fix known issues.

That's not how licenses are bought in the Enterprise, at all.\n\nMac's are also a self-selecting group; if you want a Mac, you want a Mac. So your userbase, by design, likes and understands their platform. The Windows platform is 'understood', sure, but a lot of people don't give a shit, so they have no vested interest in the platform.\n\nTheir numbers are 'right', and as mentioned before, if you only have like... 5 Mac's, then you view them as a challenge, and not a platform.",

I\u2019ve been a Jamf SME for over a decade and can tell you the product has become better and has made our lives easier to manage. Trying to learn Endpoint Manager is a bit of a learning curve but slowly noticing the parallel setups and configs needed.\n\nThe alternatives to Jamf are out there, it\u2019s just Jamf has a longer road to build their product on. It was an answer to Apple not being \u201centerprise\u201d friendly. They\u2019ve also added resources to the company to grow them globally. \n\nI would say Jamf makes it easier for admins and end users to use Macs.",

We get a bundle deal on it along with Jamf Pro and Connect. The best part is probably how easy it is to deploy as there is a built-in integration with Jamf Pro to deploy everything needed. It also has probably the best day-1 support for new macOS versions out of any EDR. Even SentinelOne, etc has had compatibility issues where they are scrambling to patch something that broke due to an update or major OS release. I don\u2019t know how it stacks up as far as MITRE evaluations against other EDR products but I\u2019m pretty happy with it. S1 is a bit more work to deploy and maintain. Not that it isn\u2019t worth it. We run both on a couple VIP endpoints.",

Syncing plans with your Jamf Pro Server is also a nice way to keep the various Plan configurations you make up to date. \n- Analytics is a pretty powerful feature. Takes some investment in learning how to write queries (this is also changing soon), but once you know how to do it there's a lot you can do with it.\n- the Jamf Security Cloud portion has a slightly harder configuration, because it a bit confusing on how to actually get the data from your endpoints that you want. \n- works best when you have a dedicated SIEM tool you're already using. Data Forwarding sources are pretty flexible for sending Telemetry Data, but they really intend for you to do a lot of analysis of events outside of the Mac Security Portal.",

        "body": "Thanks for your question. I think Jamf is a solid player in the mobile device management (MDM) and Mac management space. The company has a historic relationship with Apple Field Engineering and is used by Apple internally to manage Apple Retail Store devices. Their support teams have historically been very good, industry leading, but they do have some struggles due to being a bootstrapped company (started in 2002, VC acquisition in 2017, IPO 2020).\n\nIMO there is questionable leadership and they continually access consultants to support their operations, which is common for a large, complex organization. They also struggle with diversity and inclusion, which has become more important in recent years for financial and operational success. The quality of their software and support has slipped over the years due to these recent changes, which enables them to stay current with the market.\n\nWith Fleetsmith being acquired by Apple, versus Jamf, I think the writing is on the wall. Historically companies that are acquired tend to implode, however Jamf went IPO in 2020. It remains a modern tool for Apple device management.",

Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t meet the demands of our environment.\n\nThe remote assistance tools were slow and unreliable, with frequent connection drops during sessions—frustrating for both IT and end-users. Patch management was inconsistent, with some critical updates failing to apply automatically, requiring manual intervention. The inability to schedule patches flexibly across time zones also disrupted our global workforce.\n\nWhile Jamf offers a lot of features, the learning curve was steep. Even my experienced team needed weeks to get comfortable, and documentation wasn\u2019t easy to navigate in urgent situations. Scalability was another issue, as bulk actions failed randomly without clear error messages, slowing down operations. The reporting tools were too basic for the compliance requirements we need in fintech.\n\nJamf may work for smaller companies, but for large, compliance-heavy environments, it didn\u2019t deliver. We\u2019re already exploring alternatives that offer more reliable patching, better remote support, and smoother scaling.",

        "body": "I\u2019ve been using Jamf for our IT management needs for a while now, and while it has some great features, I've encountered several challenges that make me question its overall value.\n\nFirst off, the customer support has been hit or miss. When we initially set up the system, it took a long time to get a response to our queries. I expected more prompt assistance, especially given the complexity of the platform. When we finally got through, the support team didn\u2019t always have the answers we needed, leading to frustrating back-and-forth communications.\n\nThe patch management system is another area that could use improvement. Although it offers automation, we frequently experience issues where updates fail to install as planned. This leads to extra manual work and concerns about keeping our devices secure.\n\nAdditionally, the remote support functionality can be unreliable. Connection drops and lag during sessions make it difficult for our team to assist users effectively. When you rely on tech support, these delays can lead to significant downtime.\n\nLastly, the user interface feels a bit outdated and cluttered. It can be challenging to navigate, even for experienced team members. The documentation could also use a refresh; it often lacks the clarity needed during critical moments.\n\nOverall, while Jamf has promising features, the lack of reliable customer support and some functional shortcomings make it tough for us to fully endorse it. We're considering other options that might better meet our needs.",

I love the amount of info that is collected on the devices and the ways to export and use the data. Keeping apps and OS updated is nice. It is easy to lock a device if needed. Pretty good community to ask questions when trying to learn. Jamf support is good. I have been involved with devices already enrolled and new devices coming in. Very easy to work with. I am in Jamf everyday checking on devices or finding devices that need some help. The new remote session is great to use! I has been easy to integrate with all of our schools. Implementing new features has been pretty smooth. There are a lot of settings, called policies or configuration profiles, that can be used to limit or not limit what the end user can do. I love that I can upload a list of devices that will then update fields in jamf, such as username, building, etc.Some of the things we have tried to implement can be difficult when you get down to a very small subset. Example, trying to figure out a specific set of commands to run in a script to work set up something. The scripting part can be difficult at times, but that is not Jamf's fault. The implementation of the script can be difficult. Again, most of that is not on Jamf. I wish there was better support for the scripting part. Every once in a while I will see a setting or menu area that does not seem logical. I wish there was a way to run commands on an iOS device like you can on a MacBook. There are times when you just need to run that command and you know it would fix it, but you cannot. Again, I think that is an Apple issue not Jamf. There are times when you want to have something run automatically through Jamf, but it is not as easy as clicking a check box. It can take a short amount of time to find someone that has done the same thing, but it could take a long time. In that regard, I should use Jamf support more.It is what we use to control all of our iPads and MacBooks for students and staff. Makes updating, adding apps and adding printers so much easier than having to touch 4000 devices in our organization.",

However, if you are not advanced, then that is where the community and customer support comes in. The community members almost always have an answer or a point of view to share. The customer support has always been quick and willing to help. Really enjoy the community they have built!Only dislikes are that I can't use it for everything! Windows and Linux would be cool to be supported, but at least Android for the MDM side of things.About 10% of our enviornment is macOS, so we are using Jamf to manage those computers. It is currently allowing us to implment security settings like CIS Benchmark Hardening, it is allowing us to deploy corporate software and remove potentially unwanted programs, it is allowing us to report and provide analytics to our various business units, and it is allowing us simply patching these computers.",

It is easy for me because I have done it literally hundreds of times. We restrict all apps except for some (what we make available on Self-Service). I have to then add the bundle ID into the configuration profile. It could be a lot easier to use. But it works. And it works WELL.If you manage IT in a school or business this tool is a MUST! Not comparable to other competitors. It is very easy to use and works so well. Support is great, they help even with silly questions.It is extremely beneficial to use in a school large or small.

The web generated reports are as beautifully crafted as they are, it is hard to utilize for offline reporting needed for presenting to board members. Since a lot of these wonderful reports are in web only format, possible relevant data for export seem to be very limited in scope. This also leaves us relying on third party tools and utilizing more user and financial resources to generate similar yet far less accurate reports.Since most of the organization is remote, remote administration is a critical feature to support managing of our devices remotely. It allows us to securely access and configure devices from a centralized location, reducing the need for on-site visits or manual intervention.\nEndpoint security is an importan issue and Jamf Pro ensures that all devices are protected against malware and other cyber threats, preventing unauthorized access and data breaches.\nIdentity management integration with Okta and Google provides users with an authenticated login to access our varying corporate infrastructure and prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information.",

My only wish is that you could add an Apple account to a device through Jamf Pro. This would make it easier for iPads and Apple TV's where we use the same Apple ID on them, and lock the devices in Single App Mode. Not having to manually log in on each of these devices would make the experience that much better.Jamf is making the management and deployment of our Apple fleet so much easier than it had been.

They are diligent and helpful and quick to either find you a solution or find the right person to get you a solution.There are some features that they are lacking or are behind other MDMs in developing. It seems like between them and Mosyle, it's always a race to see who is going to implement what first and better. Mosyle was first to implement an app catalog and admin privilege requests, and their user interface looks a lot more user friendly than Jamf. Some aspects in Jamf, like configuration profiles, it can be difficult to know what settings mean without having a deep working knowledge of Apple's infrastructure.

Not to mention the simplicity of allowing a user to basically self-provision a Mac without direct IT involvement. Game changer.No downsides to the product we've seen so far. We do recommend taking advantage of Jamf's on-boarding support as every customer we've taken onto the platform has encurred some form of customization. And the integration requires advanced understanding of Jamf Pro, Jamf Connect as well as the directory provider interface. But it's well worth the energy once you watch a user un-box a factory Mac and quickly get to a fully configured desktop complete with a user account, mail, apps, documents, and preferences -- all with zero IT touch.Without full directory integration and user account snycronization, we were assigning IT staff to perform user account creation for each end user. While we could push apps and services with Jamf Pro, Jamf Connect added the final step. Now a user simply logs into a properly enrolled company-owned Mac with their email credentials ... and magically a full, local user account is created. And if a password is changed on the Mac or at the directory server, the password is sync'd between platforms. We reclaim IT services for both deployment and forgot password support. Win-Win.",
